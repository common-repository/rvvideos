This plugin automatically converts RestoVisio video URLs into an embed video player

== Description ==

This plugin automatically converts RestoVisio video URLs into an embed video player. It's very convenient and easy to use, editor just needs to copy and paste a RestoVisio URL into the post [http://www.restovisio.com/restaurant/xxxxx-ID.htm] for instance and the video player (flash or html5 depending on the device) will appear. Make sure you use the brackets otherwise the URL will remain unchanged.
The plugin does not alter your post content! It triggers on display therefore if you uninstall it your posts remain unchanged!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rvvideos.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The video player is automatically displayed into the post
2. Player size may be changed on the plugin options page
